# Vulnerability Assessment Report (NIST SP 800-30)

This project is part of the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate. It demonstrates the ability to perform a qualitative vulnerability assessment using **NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1** guidelines. The assessment focuses on a Linux database server hosting a MySQL instance and connected to a business network.

## 🖥 System Description
The assessed system consists of a Linux-based server with:
- CPU + 128GB RAM  
- MySQL database system  
- SSL/TLS for encrypted connections  
- IPv4 networking  
- Dependencies on other servers in the environment  

This system stores and processes business-critical data and interacts with other internal services.

## 🎯 Scope of Assessment
The assessment focuses specifically on:
- Current **access controls**  
- Overall **confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA)**  
- A 3-month period (June–August 20XX)  
- Risks guided by **NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1**

## 🧠 Purpose of the Analysis
This vulnerability assessment was conducted to evaluate risks that impact the security of the organization’s data. The database server supports critical business functions, and any compromise or outage could affect operations, customer trust, and revenue. Ensuring its protection is vital for business continuity and data integrity.

## 📊 Risk Assessment
A risk table was created identifying:
- **Threat sources**  
- **Threat events**  
- **Likelihood scores (1–3)**  
- **Severity scores (1–3)**  
- **Overall risk (Likelihood × Severity)**  

This provides stakeholders with a clear view of high-priority threats, aligned with NIST SP 800-30.

## 🧩 Approach
A qualitative assessment was used, relying on security knowledge and judgment to estimate risk. Threats were selected based on their relevance to the server’s functionality, the system’s attack surface, and business impact. Likelihood and severity values were determined using NIST criteria and the system’s operational context.

## 🔐 Remediation Strategy
Recommended security improvements include:
- Implementing **least privilege** and stronger access controls  
- Applying **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**  
- Deploying **defense-in-depth** with monitoring and detection controls  
- Incorporating **backup and recovery processes**  
- Strengthening password and authentication policies  

These measures mitigate the identified risks and improve the server’s overall security posture.
